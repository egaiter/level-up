# Websocket chat app

## Installation
This project requires you to have node and npm. To get up and running, simply run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. This should auto-navigate your browser to localhost:3000 and launch the app.

## Level up
For the level up, we will mostly be working on the ChatApp component located at src/components/chat/ChatApp.js
